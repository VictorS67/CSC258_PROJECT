# CSC258_PROJECT
Running Pikachu

This is the project that I created during CSC258. This project is a game design on DE1 board in verilog, containing showing images on the VGA display and logic design of the game called Running Pikachu.

## Install
This project uses [quartus prime 18.1](https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/18.1/?edition=lite&platform=linux) to compile and use [FPGA DE1-SoC board](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=836) and a monitor that have a [VGA adpter](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece241_08F/vga/) to run this program. Go check it out if you don't have them locally installed.

## Usage

You can run the [output file](RunningPikachu/output_files/RunningPikachu.sof) using the quartus prime 18.1, or you can first compile the [program](RunningPikachu/RunningPikachu.qpf), and then run it.
